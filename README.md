## Welcome! :wave: 
This is a repo for a GLEON project in which we are synthesizing global lake metabolism data and using it to test a newly development lake ecosystem model that predicts pelagic gross primary production.

## Collaborators
I am leading this project with input from many co-authors and data providers. A list of participants is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14FQnQPgZ-pgy7uB7kFIcMt7frfEgLC2RvRmYzuu9jlE/edit?usp=sharing).

## Structure
This is very much a work in progress, but in the mean time if you want to browse some draft output, feel free to poke around the `figures` folder.
